<h2>CF sinus microbiome project (CFSIN)</h2>
<br>
Since our lab's relocation to Dartmouth, I have spearheaded a new longitudinal study with Prof Bomberger and Dr Ryan Little (Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center) to study the ongoing effects of CFTR modulator therapies in adults with CF. This study focuses on adults with sinus disease and the effects of modulators on microbiota, inflammation, and olfaction. We aim to uncover novel links between time-on-modulators and alterations to community composition of the sinus microbiome, inflammatory profile, and sense of smell through multivariate analyses.

<h2>Adult CF-CRS project</h2>
<br>
As part of a collaboration between Prof Bomberger, Prof Vaughn Cooper (University of Pittsburgh), and Dr Stella Lee (Brigham and Women's Hospital) I have utilized an extensive biobank of longitudinal samples to improve our understanding of the impacts of viral-bacterial co-infection on airway microbiota in people with CF. Through interrogation of 16S rRNA sequence data and cytokine quantification we have shown that there are increases in *Pseudomonas* abundance in the airways during respiratory viral infection and that this is associated with with the airway antiviral immune response (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.01022-2025" target="_blank"><u>Hilliam <i>et al.</i> 2025</u></a>). This longitudinal study also captured the approval and subsequent rollout of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy for modulation of CFTR dysfunction in around 90% of people with CF. As a result, we were able to examine the immediate effects of ETI on the sinus microbiota and showed that whilst *Pseudomonas* burden was significantly and substantially reduced it was not eradicated from the airway (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00787-24" target="_blank"><u>Hilliam <i>et al.</i> 2024</u></a>). Ongoing work involves whole population sequencing of *P. aeruginosa* isolated from the sinuses and sputum of people with CF in order to identify movement of adaptive mutations and novel strains of *P. aeruginosa* between the upper and lower compartments of the airway. Combined, these data will allow us to better understand the changing landscape of CF treatment in the era of highly effective modulator therapies when people with CF have drastically improved symptoms but whose airways remain colonized with pathogens that are continually adapting to a novel host environment.

<h2><i>In vitro</i> modeling of polymicrobial communities in the CF airways</h2>
<br>
Building on an <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81604" target="_blank"><u>excellent foundation</u></a> laid by Dr Fabrice Jean-Pierre (Université de Sherbrooke), I am currently developing a co-culture model of the CF airway microbiome in which we can compete *P. aeruginosa* against other bacterial pathogens in order to better understand the role of conserved type VI secretion system immunity proteins in protecting interlopers from killing by *P. aeruginosa* and how mechanisms of interbacterial competition may be regulated to achieve dominance of the microbial community by *P. aeruginosa* during chronic airway infections.
