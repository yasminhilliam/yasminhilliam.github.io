<h1>Education</h1>

<h2>PhD Medical Microbiology</h2>

University of Liverpool, United Kingdom

Thesis title: Resistance and tolerance of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> to contact lens disinfection solutions
>My research focused on screening a large collection of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates from clinical ocular keratitis infections for resistance to a commercially available multipurpose contact lens disinfection solution. I also demonstrated the development of a tolerance phenotype during sub-inhibitory exposure to the disinfection solution, and identified a potential mechanism for the altered susceptibility through proteomic and transcriptomic analysis.

<h2>MPhil Medical Microbiology</h2>

University of Liverpool, United Kingdom

Thesis title: Genotyping of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolates from pulmonary infections in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients
>My research aimed to increase understanding of the population genetics of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in chronic lung infections in people with bronchiectasis. We showed that there was little evidence of patient-to-patient transmission of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> between patients at treatment centers, nor was there evidence of clustering of isolates based on geographical location. We also showed that patients tended to maintain the same strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in the lungs through many years of chronic infection with little evidence of strain replacement. 

<h2>BSc (Hons) Microbiology</h2>

University of Liverpool, United Kingdom

Thesis title: Tracking mutations in the genome of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in cystic fibrosis patients
>My undergraduate research project focused on identifying fixed mutations within the genome of the highly transmissible Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. The project aimed to uncover the likely order of acquisition of fixed mutations in three genes in modern isolates of LES. I was unable to elucidate the sequence of transmission events that occurred to allow for the accumulation of these fixed mutation but gained a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of pathoadaptation that are observed in chronic <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections.
