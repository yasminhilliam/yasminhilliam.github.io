<h1>About me</h1>
I am a research scientist in the Bomberger Lab at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. My research combines both bench science and bioinformatic analysis of clinical data to identify mechanisms of disease in bacterial and viral infections of the human airways, with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis. Through interrogation of genomic, microbiome, and transcriptomic data from clinical samples we can identify potential virulence determinants during infection. These findings are then taken back into the lab in the form of <i>in vitro</i> models to confirm their importance and mode of action. The final aim of this work is to generate novel therapeutics to treat and prevent bacterial infections in the sinuses and lungs by working with clinicians to carry out clinical studies that implement our findings to help patients.

<h4>I am currently seeking employment in the UK or Europe as a postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics with a focus on ecology and evolution of microbial pathogens or the role of the microbiome in disease.</h4><br>
